## 📦 Research Plan: Optimizing the Supply Chain in the Face of Uncertainty

### 🧭 Overview
An **optimal supply chain** is one that is stable, predictable, and characterized by low variability. However, in reality, supply chains operate under constant uncertainty—driven by demand fluctuations, supply disruptions, lead time variability, and external shocks.

As a result, the goal shifts from eliminating uncertainty (which is often impossible) to reducing variability where possible, and containing it where necessary.

To achieve this, three key strategies could be applied:

- **Segmentation:**
Break down the supply chain into smaller, manageable segments based on product type, customer behavior, demand patterns, or service levels. This allows for more targeted strategies and localized optimization.

- **Shift from Correlation to Causality:**
Within each segment, go beyond surface-level associations. Identify causal drivers of variability to enable more effective interventions and decision-making. Understanding “why” variability occurs is more powerful than just knowing “when” it does.

- **Anomaly Detection:**
Use anomaly detection models to flag deviations from expected behavior. This helps contain disruptions by triggering early warnings, allowing rapid response to prevent cascading failures or inefficiencies.

### 🛠️ Methodology
<!--
To address the causal questions at the heart of this work, a hybrid approach will be employed, drawing from structural models, quasi-experiments, causal machine learning, and simulation.

---

#### 🧠 1. Structural Causal Models (SCM)



---

#### 🧪 2. Quasi-Experimental Designs




---

#### 🤖 3. Causal Machine Learning

To handle high-dimensional data, discover treatment heterogeneity, and support complex modeling:

- **Causal Forests** (e.g., Generalized Random Forests)
- **Double Machine Learning (DML)**
- **Meta-learners**: S-learner, T-learner, X-learner
- **Uplift Modeling** for individual-level intervention targeting

**Toolkits**: `EconML`, `CausalML`, `scikit-uplift`, `DoWhy + sklearn`

These methods enable estimation at **scale**, with interpretability and flexibility.

#### 🧪 4. Simulation Modeling

Simulation will be used to model dynamics that are hard to capture empirically:

- **System Dynamics Models**: Capture stock-flow relationships and feedback loops (e.g., inventory → lead times → customer abandonment)
- **Agent-Based Models (ABM)**: Represent decision-making by individual customers, suppliers, or fulfillment centers
- **Scenario Testing**: Examine the effects of hypothetical interventions (e.g., algorithmic changes or new delivery policies)

Simulation allows us to **stress-test** causally-informed strategies in synthetic but realistic environments.

### 📏 Evaluation Strategy
<!--
#### 🔬 Simulation Validation

- **Historical backtesting**: Compare simulation outcomes to observed behavior
- **Face validity**: Are dynamics reasonable to domain experts?
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Explore robustness of outcomes to model assumptions

#### 📈 Empirical Evaluation

- **Causal identification**: Are estimated effects statistically and practically valid?
- **Operational interpretability**: Do findings align with stakeholder understanding?
- **Counterfactual testing**: Can the models answer "what-if" questions reliably?
